## üìã Overview  
This project is a digital slot machine game with basic casino functionalities, developed in Unity.  
The following design patterns were used:
   - **Model-View-Controller** for separation of responsibilities in Views;
   - **Singleton** for managing global systems.

The artwork was generated by the AI **DALL-E** to ensure visual consistency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architectures and Patterns  
### **Singleton**  
- Used for centralized management classes:
   - `AudioManager`: Manages the audio flow of the game.    
   - `GameManager`: Controls the game flow.
   - `SlotMachineManager`: Manages the flow of slot machine instances.  
   - `UIManager`: Manages interface elements.
- Used for centralized system classes:
   - `CreditSystem`: Synchronizes the player's credits.  
   - `JackpotSystem`: Synchronizes the jackpot across machines.
   - `LogSystem`: Synchronizes the log of each machine.  

### **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**  
- **Model**: Data classes such as `SymbolAssetConfig` and `GameConfig`.  
- **View**: UI elements and animations (e.g., `SlotMachineView`).  
- **Controller**: Business logic (e.g., `SlotMachineViewController`).
